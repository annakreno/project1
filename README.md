Next Steps:

    - Set different prize amounts for different icon jackpots.
    - Look into random number generator, doesn't seem to land on jackpot the statistically expected number of times, lowered the options to return so that it'd land on jackpot more easily for demo purposees.
    - Smooth the transition between spinning slot and the landed upon icon.
